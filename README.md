# DynamicModeling
These are MATLAB code I wrote while having Coursera Course Dynamic Modeling Methods for System Biology (course taught by by Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai
Eric Sobie, PhD).

Here I learned how to model biological dynamic systems with ODEs, PDEs, manipulation of data with MATLAB etc.
